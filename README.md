__TEK Systems Hiring Final Round, 48 hour based Hackathon__.



# Movie Analysis

If you have a little information about a movie and wants to know more about it with that little hint/thing, This problem statement will help you to find the complete details and information about the movie using that hint which you'll provide as an input.



## Scope of Problem statement

```
  * Text processing

  * Image processing

  * Data Pre-processing

  * Data Visualization

  * Prediction with Machine Learning
```

## opencv

Here, OpenCV __build and source__ files are not included in the Repo due to big size.

So, we have included those files in [G-Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hJIj4qZ1DPpRZxODQz6kRVLxDTADdyLo).

Download those files/folder and place it in workspace along with __README__ and __movie_data_analysis.py__.
