After the initial peaceful demonstrations  a mob goes on rampage and attacks some of the Muslims and the shops. This prompts one Muslim shop-owner  Mamdu  to set fire to the tree temple.

Sinha presides over a meeting attended by influential industrialist Meghnad Chaudhry  Union leader Vilas Rao and minister Mantriji  among others. The men have a difference of opinion  which leads to a heated argument  and Sinha terminates the meeting without arriving at a decision on the policy. Sinha is the step-father of Sahil Sinha  whose mother Sharda began to live with Sinha after the death of husband. Sahil is an unattached and easy-going young man  who harbors resentment towards Sinha  despite living with Sinha. Sinha also has a younger son named Harsh. Ishwar Dewan is Sinha 's Personal Secretary  and Sinha daughter Isha is Sahil 's beloved. On the other hand  Sheetal  the daughter of Chaudhry  is also in love with Sahil  but this is not reciprocated by Sinha. One evening  Sinha organizes a party for Sahil 's birthday  and Sinha announces Sahil 's engagement to Sheetal. Sahil is engaged and an argument breaks out. At one point  a furious Sahil picks up a knife in order to stab step father  only to be stopped by Sharda. The next day  Sahil gets heavily drunk at the house of Dr Gandhi  Sinha 's family doctor  who advises Sahil to accept Sheetal as Sheetal wife on the grounds that Sahil will lead a happier life with Sheetal. An intoxicated Sahil returns home and finds to Sheetal shock and horror that someone has stabbed Sinha. Before Sinha can utter the name of the murderer to Sahil  Sinha dies  while Sharda arrives and finds Sahil near Sinha dead step-father holding a knife smeared with blood. Sahil is accused and taken to court  where many of Sinha acquaintances including Chaudhry  Vilas Rao  Mantriji  lawyer Thanawala and Sharda testify against Sinha. Sahil is found guilty and sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment. Just before Sahil is transported to jail  Sinha stealthily hands over a necklace to Sheetal  implying that Sahil was left behind at the scene of the crime by the killer. In jail  Sahil relates the story of Sahil false imprisonment to an old prisoner  who believes Sahil to be innocent. The prisoner tells Sahil that the jail only has one escape route - a sewage gutter pipe which extends into the sea. This gutter pipe can be accessed from a flush toilet located in an unused chamber of the jail. Sahil creates a problem with other prisoners  causing the jailor to confine Sinha and two prisoners in the chamber. The three succeed in escaping the jail by sea  with a boat arranged by Sheetal  as previously planned. Police Commissioner Patwardhan assigns an unbending and resolute police officer Udham Singh to handle the case of Sahil 's re-apprehension. Udham Singh and two constables Neelkanth and Pandu start the search for Sahil. Sahil secretly meets Isha at Isha home  where Udham calls Dr Gandhi for advice  and Dr Gandhi invites Sahil to Udham home later that night to discuss the situation. Sahil reaches the doctors residence and is shocked to find that somebody has stabbed Dr Gandhi to death. Dr Gandhi 's servant finds Sahil near the dead doctor and shrieks  causing Udham to run away. Dr Gandhi 's servant reports Sahil to the police. Udham Singh strengthens the search operation for Sahil and interrogates Sheetal  with whom Sahil still maintains a good relationship. After being persistently questioned by Singh  Sheetal confesses to having spent the previous night with Sahil and also helping Singh escape jail. Singh does not arrest Sheetal for these wrongdoings  but sarcastically advises Sheetal father to get Singh insane daughter immediately admitted into India 's biggest mental asylum situated in Agra. Sahil  knowing that Singh has been wrongfully accused of killing Sinha and Dr Gandhi  decides to find the real murderer. Singh suspects Thanawala of the murders  because Thanawala had every likelihood of obtaining Sinha 's property upon Sinha death  provided Sahil is out of the picture. Thanawala violently questions Thanawala and figures the Thanawala is not the murderer. Meanwhile  Chaudhry and Chaudhry brother promise a reward to anybody who informs of Sahil 's whereabouts. Sahil now finds reasons to suspect Chaudhry or Chaudhry brother to be the murderer because of Chaudhry 's involvement in business fraud. After interrogating Chaudhry  Sahil realises that Chaudhry is innocent as well. The next target of Sahil is Vilas Rao  the corrupt Union leader  who points the finger at Mantriji  saying that Sinha 's murder was a political assassination. Sahil and Sheetal trick Mantriji into attending a ceremony without Sinha security guards  and kidnap Sinha. Udham Singh is also present at the ceremony and realizes that Sahil is not the real murderer. Udham Singh finds out that the two murders have been committed with two knives of exactly the same construction and shape  that could belong to a set. After some investigstions  Udham finds the set of knives at Ishwar Dewan 's house and arrests Dewan after Udham confesses to killing Sinha and Dr Gandhi. Dewan divulges to have murdered Sinha because even after years of Sinha fidelity to Sinha as Sinha Personal Secretary  Sinha did not accept Isha as Sinha daughter-in-law  and killed Dr Gandhi to cover up the first crime. At the same time  Sahil interrogates Mantriji in order to elicit the confession from Sinha of being the murderer. Sheetal arrives and tells Sinha that the murderer  none other than Ishwar Dewan  has been arrested  making Sahil release Mantriji. At Ishwar house  Udham Singh along with Neelkanth and Pandu celebrate the successful conclusion of this baffling case. Harsh  Sinha 's son  is seen playing with the necklace which Sahil had found at the crime scene. Sinha opens the necklace locket and is shocked to find a picture of Isha inside. Sinha figures that Isha is greatly involved in the whole situation. Harsh goes to visit Ishwar  who reveals that Isha had committed the crimes but Sinha does n't want Isha to be put in jail  therefore  Sinha falsely confessed. Isha has been stalking Sheetal  and finally attacks Isha  but Sheetal is saved by Sahil. Enraged by Sahil 's concern for Sheetal  Isha behind to attack them but is shot by Udham Singh. Sahil embraces Isha  and Sinha asks Isha why Isha committed the murders  as Sinha was always here.

However  Suryakanth 's suggestion of adding sex and eroticism  to make the film more commercially viable  angers Abraham. Silk slowly builds a name for herself in the industry and goes on to do many more sexually charged films with Suryakanth  which catapults her into stardom. She gains many male fans and  in a short time  becomes immensely rich and popular as a Southern sex symbol. Suryakanth 's younger brother Ramakanth is an admirer of Silk and starts to befriend her. Silk develops a liking for Suryakanth  after she realizes that Suryakanth is the first man who loves her for more than just her body and sex appeal. At an awards ceremony Silk is praised for her performance but is insulted by Suryakanth who tells her that she is nothing more than everyone 's `` dirty secret . Hurt by remarks  Silk announces that she will continue to make her `` dirty pictures  and that she has no qualms in doing so She begins to spend more time with Ramakanth and becomes the focus of tabloid gossip after noted journalist Naila criticises Silk for having a romantic relationship with both brothers.

Silk approaches Silva Ganesh with an offer to produce a film together. Ultimately  the audience and industry has lost interest in Naila  and the film fails. On the other hand  Abraham directs a film which turns out to be a huge hit  and Abraham feels that Abraham has finally proven to Silk that Abraham films do not need any sexualisation to be successful. Having lost Naila fame and fortune  Silk has accumulated so much debt that Naila approaches a small-time filmmaker  willing to take on any role. Naila is shocked to find that Abraham wants Naila to do a pornographic film  and Naila refuses. Abraham intoxicates Naila with alcohol and starts filming  without Naila permission. The place is raided by the police but Silk manages to escape. Abraham finds Abraham falling in love with Silk  even though Abraham denies it first  as Abraham struggles with this moral dilemma. During a phone conversation with Silk  Abraham becomes alarmed when Naila asks Abraham to bid farewell to everyone for Naila. Abraham rushes to Naila house  and finds Naila lying in bed dead from a sleeping pill overdose  along with a suicide note. The film ends with Abraham 's narration  examining the life that Silk has led  and Abraham questions whether the consequences Naila faced from Naila actions were justified or not.
